/**
 * An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike
 * that took exactly steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, U,
 * or a downhill, D step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step
 * up or down represents a unit change in altitude. We define the following
 * terms:
 * 
 * A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with
 * a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level. A valley
 * is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down
 * from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level. Given the sequence of
 * up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked
 * through.
 * 
 * Example
 * 12
 * DDUUDDUDUUUD
 * _    _      /\_
 *  \  / \    /  
 *   \/   \/\/
 * 
 * OUTPUT 2
